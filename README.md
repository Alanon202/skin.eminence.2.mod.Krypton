# skin.eminence.2.mod.Krypton

IMPORTANT SETUP TIPS: 

1. The skin works in Krypton only!

2. Marcelveldt's BETA Repo is required for most of the skin dependencies. If you install it, the most necessary things for the skin to work should install automatically. If you encounter any errors, please try to download the dependencies manually, install them as zips, and then re-install the skin.

3. If you are backing up or restoring your skin settings, beware of two things - first, the location of your backups (see the Skin Helper Backup add-on settings), and second - properly restoring your header, widget bevel and other settings that need to be defined. For example: If you can't see the widget discs after a restore, that means you must re-set the bevel setting (literally just set it again) .

4. For the Weather widget to work, you must install the multi fanart artwork. For the moment it is needed for the widget to appear.

5. Special music artwork needs to be organised as follows: 
   Artist/logo.png;
   Artist/Album/disc.png OR Artist/Album/cdart.png;
   The path you set in the skin settings is the root (pointing to the Artist folders).

6. manfeed's lyrics will only work in the default font set, since arial defeats the purpose of the mod.

7. The French language strings are outdated, don't use them.
